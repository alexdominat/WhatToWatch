1505	PnB Rock	artist	\N	174287	\N	R&amp;B music isn’t all flowers and candy; just ask Rakim “PnB Rock” Allen.\nThe 23-year-old singer’s earliest inspiration didn’t come from the bedroom, but from the streets. “At first I would look at R&amp;B artists like they’re all about love, and soft. Then I saw you could be a street boy and sing and still be hot. I knew I could do that shit,” he says.\nPnB Rock hails from Pastorius and Baynton Streets in the Germantown section of Philadelphia — that’s where he found the “P” and “B” in his name. That’s also where he found himself in a bit of trouble.\nWhen Rock was 13 years old, he got sent away to a youth detention program for fighting in school and committing robberies. When Rock turned 19, he was sent to prison; it was there where he learned to blend calming melodies with hard street stories.“There were people up there singing in the yard. They were doing the same thing that I was doing, but they were serious with it,” he remembers. “There would be crowds around them and that was our entertainment, everybody loved it.” PnB wrote his entire first mixtape RNB (Real Nigga Bangaz), while he was locked up and eventually released in 2014. “My first mixtape was highly anticipated in my city and I drove around selling them hand-to-hand,” he says, remarking that he barely made any money off the sales after he factored in the cost of gas. “It was all love because people got to take pictures and meet me face-to-face.”\nThe bubbling singer/songwriter explored his musical side; a side which was fueled by his mother’s massive CD collection which included albums from the Temptations as well as 2Pac, The Notorious B.I.G. and Jay Z. “My whole life I was surrounded by music. I didn’t really like anything else,” he says. “I didn’t watch cartoons, I didn’t play sports, I just liked music, money and girls.”\nWhen RNB2 dropped in February 2015, Rock’s loyal following had propelled him way past his native Philly blocks. It was enough to earn the attention of a number of major labels, including Atlantic Records, where PnB Rock signed earlier this year.\nIf RNB and RNB2 laid the foundation, PnB’s newly released RNB3 will set the stage for a long career. Led by tracks like “Fleek” — a song which Rock wrote during his last day in prison and now has over 2.4 million plays on SoundCloud — RNB3 will be PnB Rock’s biggest yet.\nOn the Sonny Digital-produced “Alone,” he opens up about his shortcomings as a man, admitting that he hasn’t been the most faithful. “Maybe I could turn down 10, but I can’t turn down 20,” he sings about the amount of advances he gets on social media.\nThen there are his more laid back tracks like “Feelin Like Diddy” and “No Time,” better known as the ultimate hustler’s anthem. “I’m just telling a female that I could give you whatever you want, but I’m not trying to be tied down,” he says. “I could entertain you and fuck with you, but don’t expect me to be committed to nobody. I’m committed to the grind.”\nYou see, when it comes to PnB Rock, it’s best to leave the flowers and candy behind. You won’t be needing them. “I got a new sound for sure,” he says. “I could touch different topics that these other artists can’t touch, because I’m in the streets.” Read more on Last.fm.

Season two premiered on Japan's SUN-TV on January 2003, with the American premiere taking place seven months later. Following the closure of Bandai Entertainment in 2012, Sunrise had announced at Otakon 2013, that both seasons of The Big O along with a handful of former BEI titles would be rescued by Sentai Filmworks.	7.40000000000000036	2001	[{"tag":"Action & Adventure"},{"tag":"Animation"}]	2019-09-02 05:25:36.922+00	2019-09-02 05:26:07.757+00	2

Hailing from the San Francisco Bay Area, Adrian Marcel separates himself from what R&amp;B has become and strives to bring back what traditional rhythm and blues is. His goal is to inspire today’s youth to know and experience what true R&amp;B sounds like. Adrian feels like vocalists back in the day had only their voices, no outlandish tricks or antics, just themselves and a microphone. Thus, he is looking to bring class back to R&amp;B music. A.M. is like no other when he performs. On stage he makes the audience understand that they are listening to a story, a plot, a time-line or a specific moment in his life, not just a song. He truly puts on a full fledged show. Being a singer, songwriter, composer, performer and natural comedian helps him incorporate different dynamics into his shows. A.M. draws his influence from the likes of Jackie Wilson, Frankie Lyman, David Ruffin, Carl Thomas, Tank, and Maxwell.	\N	\N	[{"tag":"Hip-hop"},{"tag":"R & b"}]	2019-09-02 05:25:39.116+00	2019-09-02 05:26:10.828+00	2

644	The Beatles	artist	\N	95773	\N	The Beatles were an iconic rock group from Liverpool, England. They are frequently cited as the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed band in modern history, with innovative music, a cultural impact that helped define the 1960s and an enormous influence on music that is still felt today. Currently, The Beatles are one of the two musical acts to sell more than 1 billion records, with only Elvis Presley having been able to achieve the same feat.\n     \nAfter conquering Europe, with successful tours to Germany and Sweden, the Beatles led the mid-1960s musical 'British Invasion' into the United States. Although their initial musical style was rooted in 1950s rock and roll and homegrown skiffle, the group explored a great variety of musical styles including Psychedelic Rock, Experimental, Ballads, Western and Indian Classical among others. Their clothes, hairstyles, and statements made them trend-setters, while their growing social awareness saw their influence extend into the social and cultural revolutions of the 1960s. \n     \nEarly on, the band consisted of George Harrison, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Stuart Sutcliffe, and Pete Best. The band got its first major break playing in Hamburg, Germany, at some rather seedy nightclubs, beginning in 1960. While in Germany, they also met Klaus Voormann, who would later design the cover of the group's 1966 album Revolver. Sutcliffe remained in Germany when the others returned to England and became engaged to fellow artist Astrid Kirchherr, only to die a few years later of a brain hemorrhage.	\N	\N	[{"tag":"Psychedelic"},{"tag":"Rock"}]	2019-09-02 05:25:39.24+00	2019-09-02 05:26:11.478+00	2

"Crazy Love" by Van Morrison, that's simply timeless. They influence me; As a composer and interpreter, I want to connect as they did. And when your audience feels that they can relate, then you have something much more special than a show or a sale. You have a fan. "When it comes to Brett Young, it's not that far from a pitcher's mound on a main stage, and it does not really matter what kind of Big Show you're talking about, because in the end, when you have that thing called heart, You can see it in his eyes, but he will hear it in his voice.\nSince then, Brett has played on stages ranging from House of Blues to Troubadour, and shared stages with artists such as Mandy Moore, Tyrone Wells, Jason Reeves, Gavin Degraw, Tyler Hilton, Katy Perry, Hoku and many more.

743	Casey Veggies	artist	\N	118028	\N	Casey “Casey Veggies” Jones may be young but he definitely knows the value of prioritizing. Although this 90’s baby (born July 18, 1993) came into high school with hoop dreams, playing shooting guard for Inglewood High School’s Sentinels, the L.A. native soon realized that in pursuing basketball he was really just sleeping on another talent- rapping.\nBack in ninth grade, the young MC had been recording songs and posting them on his Myspace page just for fun. After receiving positive feedback on a few of the tracks, Veggies began to re-evaluate his relationship with music.\n“I was just writing and writing but then when I began recording things just started to fall into place,” says the 11th grader. “The response I got made me take it more seriously.”\nWith his first mixtape project, 2007’s Customized Greatly Vol. 1, the 16 year-old lyricist proved that he had the potential to be more than just another Myspace artist. He followed up that project a year later with Customized Greatly Vol. 2 which produced “I’m Right Here” and “It’s All Good,” two songs that picked up around the city. By junior year, he realized that this was something that he not only wanted, but needed to do. So he traded in the hard wood for the stage, dusted off his rhyme book and started getting even more serious about his music. He was making a name for himself amongst the younger crowd in Los Angeles, but now he has his sights set on greater gains. Vol. 1 was somewhat of an experiment, Vol. 2 a test, but now the teen-aged spitter is ready for graduation.\nSleeping in Class, his third solo project, and arguably his most evolved yet, promises to be a culmination of the lessons he’s learned over the last couple of years. The tape intends to prove that while the young artist is not quite seasoned, his potential is definitely ripe.\n“I’m trying to be diverse and versatile but at the same time I want it to be more real than gimmicky,” says Veggies. “It’ll be real hip-hop and me most of the time trying to convey a message but there will be fun songs here and there.”\nBut the humble 90’s-born baby has already laid a strong foundation for that. He’s exhibited his versatility on every track he’s laced to date, from “Tunnel Vision” a popular, yet serious joint off Vol. 2, to “Come On” an infectious party anthem featuring Def Jam artist YG, off his Bum Shit mixtape. However, unlike Bum Shit, which dropped this past April in collaboration with Rich Hil and was recorded in one day with no pen, no pad at Paramount Studios, Sleeping in Class is a more personal project.\n“I’m moving a little away from the volumes,” says Veggies. “I want to prove to people that I’m serious, that I can put together a full project.”\nAnd Casey still hasn’t dropped the ball on his schoolwork. Under the tutelage and management of Arrogant Veggies, the brand/creative circle of friends behind him and their affiliated clothing line, Peas and Carrots, coupled with his steadfast work ethic, Veggies is expected to be a shoe-in for his graduating class’ pick for “Most Likely to Succeed” when he crosses the stage in Spring 2011. Veggies are obviously good for you and so is his music. Live and grow. Read more on Last.fm.

681	blink-182	artist	\N	120263	\N	Blink-182 is an American rock band formed in Poway, a suburb of San Diego, California in 1992. The band currently consists of bassist and vocalist Mark Hoppus, drummer Travis Barker, and guitarist and vocalist Matt Skiba. Blink-182 is considered a key group in the development of pop punk; the band's combination of pop melodies with fast-paced punk rock featured a more radio-friendly accessibility than prior bands. Founded by Hoppus, guitarist and vocalist Tom DeLonge, and drummer Scott Raynor, the band emerged from the Southern California punk scene of the early 1990s and first gained notoriety for high-energy live shows and irreverent lyrical toilet humor.	\N	\N	[{"tag":"Punk"},{"tag":"Punk Pop"}]	2019-09-02 05:25:39.286+00	2019-09-02 05:26:13.885+00	2

The band consists of Damon Albarn (vocals, guitar, keyboards), Graham Coxon (guitar, vocals), Alex James (bass) and Dave Rowntree (drums). Blur's debut album Leisure (1991) incorporated the sounds of Madchester and Shoegazing and spawned their first UK Top 10 single, There's No Other Way. Following a stylistic change in 1992 (influenced by English guitar groups such as The Kinks, The Beatles, The Animals and XTC) Blur released "Popscene" as a stand alone single, this was a commercial flop, but was widely considered to be a crucial turning point for the band's style. Following this, Blur released 3 studio albums in a similar style: Modern Life Is Rubbish (1993), Parklife (1994) and The Great Escape (1995). As a result, the band helped to popularise the Britpop genre and achieved mass popularity in the UK, aided by a famous chart battle with rival band Oasis dubbed "The Battle of Britpop".	\N	\N	[{"tag":"British Indie Rock/Pop"},{"tag":"Indie"}]	2019-09-02 05:25:39.29+00	2019-09-02 05:26:13.897+00	2

Based in Port Arthur, Texas, UGK signed with Jive and with 1992's 'Too Hard to Swallow' began a series of Southern gangsta rap albums that were successful sellers. Bun B formed the side project Mddl Fngz in 2000, but his main concern was still UGK. Things came to halt in 2003 when Pimp C was sentenced to eight years in prison on an aggravated gun assault charge. Bun B carried on solo, making numerous appearances on other artists' tracks and then in 2005 releasing both the mixtape Legends and his debut album, Trill, a Top Ten hit. With Pimp C seeing early release in late 2005, Bun B returned to UGK and a self-titled double album from the duo dropped in 2007. Tragedy struck in late 2007 when Pimp C died suddenly, leaving Bun B to return to a solo career. His second solo album, II Trill, arrived in May of the next year. Trill O.G., his third solo album, was released in August of 2010. Read more on Last.fm.

730	Candlebox	artist	\N	118330	\N	Candlebox is a rock band from Seattle, Washington. Formed in December 1991, they originally named the band Uncle Duke and later changed it as a tribute to a song by Midnight Oil. They were sometimes looked down upon by grunge fans for their style, which was considered by many to be a derivative version of true grunge, and their commercial success suffered as a result. Despite this, the band played the Seattle club circuit during the early 1990s to the many of the same fans who had supported many of the bands that had come immediately before them. The members did not consider Candlebox to be a grunge band however; they viewed themselves as a rock and roll band more than anything. Nevertheless, Candlebox had sold more than 4 million copies of their self-titled debut which, after many months of gaining momentum, peaked at number 7 on Billboard's album charts. Their follow up album, Lucy, was certified as platinum. Their third and last album was Happy Pills, which was released in 1998. Candlebox was the first successful act on Madonna's Maverick Records, which went on to sign Alanis Morissette, Deftones, and Prodigy.	\N	\N	[{"tag":"Alternative Rock"},{"tag":"Grunge"}]	2019-09-02 05:25:39.358+00	2019-09-02 05:26:14.084+00	2

797	Craig Mack	artist	\N	115794	\N	Craig Mack (May 10, 1971 – March 12, 2018) was an American rapper who gained a considerable amount of fame on Puff Daddy's Bad Boy Entertainment record label in the 1990s. Although his first single was released under the name MC EZ in 1988, he is best known for his 1994 hit single Flava In Ya Ear, which was released under his real name. The star-studded posse-cut remix of the single was the breakout appearance of the label's most popular artist the Notorious B.I.G., as well as one of the first solo appearances by Busta Rhymes. The success of The Notorious B.I.G.'s debut album Ready To Die overshadowed Mack's early success on the Bad Boy label, and without being able to bounce back with another commercially successful album, Mack hasn't been in the limelight since the 90s.	\N	\N	[{"tag":"East Coast Rap"},{"tag":"Rap/Hip-Hop"}]	2019-09-02 05:25:39.439+00	2019-09-02 05:26:14.301+00	2

She has since parted company with her label, claiming via her official Tumblr blog that this was by mutual consent and for purely creative reasons. As of February 2012, Vickers has released two promotional singles, Music to Make Boys Cry and Kiss Of a Bullet for free download, and given a clip of another song Boy In Paris to fans via Soundcloud.

Born Shelley Marshaun Massenburg-Smith in Germany, the Virginia-based artist released his debut mixtape, #1 Epic Summer, in 2014. It featured the single "Cha Cha," a club-worthy cut that was a regional hit. In 2015, he broke on a national scale when Cleveland R&amp;B radio station Z 107.9 FM began playing the cut as their "weekend warmer," a campaign that eventually reached Beyoncé, who shared a video of her own version of the track. With Queen B's co-sign, "Cha Cha" was re-released that year while #1 Epic reappeared as an EP. Following the increased exposure brought on by "Cha Cha"'s success, D.R.A.M. released another mixtape, the aptly titled Gahdamn! in October 2015. Months later, he scored a hit with the Lil' Yachty-assisted "Broccoli." The track went gold and had risen into the Billboard Top 40 by the time summer rolled around in 2016. That October, D.R.A.M. issued his debut LP, Big Baby D.R.A.M. Debuting in the Top 20, the effort included "Broccoli," as well as guest appearances by Erykah Badu and Young Thug. The collaborations continued in early 2017 with the single "Gilligan," which featured A$AP Rocky and Juicy J, and a guest spot on the "Girl at Coachella" single by Matoma. ~ David Jeffries & Neil Z.

Born in Newmarket, Suffolk in 1968 to a Scottish mother and Afro-American G.I. father, Carroll began singing with her sister at a young age, and after winning a talent competition at school, she decided to pursue a career in the music industry. In her teens, she moved to West London after signing to independent dance label, Streetwave, where she provided uncredited vocals for a production outfit named Masquerade. In 1989, she signed to Jive/Zomba Records where she released several club hits, including a cover of Dionne Warwick's "Walk On By," and contributed to Brothers in Rhythm's single "Peace and Harmony." Her breakthrough came in 1991, when she appeared on Quartz's Top Ten dance reworking of Carole King's "It's Too Late," and was offered an album deal by A&amp;M Records. Two years later, her first LP, So Close, had spawned two Top Five singles, "Don't Be a Stranger" and a rendition of Sunset Boulevard number "The Perfect Year" helped her to scoop Best British Female Vocalist at the 1994 Brit Awards, and up until Dido's No Angel, was the biggest-selling debut album by a female artist in U.K. chart history. After moving to Mercury Records, she developed otosclerosis, a hereditary bone disease which affects the ears, whilst working on her sophomore, Only Human, which despite reaching number two, failed to achieve the same multi-platinum sales of its predecessor. Carroll changed directions for her self-titled third effort, hooking up with Rhett Lawrence in Los Angeles for a dance-pop sound reminiscent of her club roots, but although lead single "Without Love" reached the Top 20, various record company wranglings meant that plans for its release were shelved. Other than a performance of Van Morrison's "Someone Like You" on the Bridget Jones soundtrack, and a 2001 hits compilation, Carroll hasn't released any new material since	\N	\N	[{"tag":"Other Pop"},{"tag":"Pop"}]	2019-09-02 05:25:39.517+00	2019-09-02 05:26:14.541+00	2

889	Das EFX	artist	\N	115172	\N	The duo “Das EFX” emerged in 1991 from the well-established East Coast Hip-Hop scene. The group is composed of Willie “Skoob” Hines and Andre “Krazy Drayz” Weston. With their first album “Dead serious” released in 1992, the group creates a mini-revolution by using an ultra-fast rap associated with funky beats. The album was a commercial success. The following year, Das EFX released their second LP “Straight up Sewaside", “Hold it down” in 1995, and “Generation EFX” in 1998. Their last album was "How We Do" which was released in 2003.  \n-----------\n Das EFX's wildly playful, rapid-fire stuttering -- dense with rhymes and nonsense words -- was one of the most distinctive and influential lyrical styles in early-'90s hip-hop. While the duo completely rewrote the MC rule book, they themselves were increasingly pegged as a one-dimensional novelty the longer their career progressed, despite watching elements of their style creep into countless rappers' bags of tricks. Krazy Drazyz (born Andre Weston; Teaneck, NJ) and Skoob (born Willie Hines) were both raised in Brooklyn, but didn't begin performing together until they met at Virginia State University in 1988. Removed from an active music scene, the two were free to develop their most idiosyncratic tendencies; they started making up gibberish words (anything ending in "-iggity" was a favorite) that added loads of extra syllables to their lines, and wove plenty of pop-cultural references into the tongue-twisting lyrical gymnastics that resulted. Das EFX caught their big break when they performed at a talent show judged by EPMD; though they didn't win, EPMD was impressed enough to offer them a deal, and the duo became part of the Hit Squad crew of protégés.	\N	\N	[{"tag":"East Coast Rap"},{"tag":"Rap/Hip-Hop"}]	2019-09-02 05:25:39.555+00	2019-09-02 05:26:14.653+00	2

The band's name may seem a peculiar choice to fans, as an incubus is a type of demon that, in mythological lore, comes in the night and has sex with women while they are sleeping; it seduces them in their dreams The story behind the name is that the band needed to think of a name hours before their first show and, after a few failed choices, Mike looked in a dictionary and chose "Incubus" almost at random. Mike says that the name was chosen because it sounded silly; Brandon holds that it was chosen because they were teenagers and the definition had the word "sex" in it. "We really didn't want to rape women in their sleep. But, we were fifteen and it seemed harmless to us then, and we never changed it," says the band.	\N	\N	[{"tag":"137"},{"tag":"17"}]	2019-09-02 05:25:39.729+00	2019-09-02 05:26:15.185+00	2

1091	Jazz Cartier	artist	\N	104905	\N	When it comes to talent in the city of Toronto, it takes a lot to separate yourself from the other artists trying to make it big. For some it takes time, for others, it’s just natural. Jazz Cartier is a native of Toronto, but has been influenced by his travels all over the world. From growing up in Toronto, to being introduced to music in Barbados, and starting his career as an artist in Atlanta, it took a lot to get Cartier where he is now. Amongst it all, he kept to his roots, and always made it back to the city that inspires him the most. Artists like Black Sheep, Jon. B, Lauryn Hill, Kanye West, to name a few have been essential throughout the growth of Cartier as an artist. Not going out of his comfort zone, Cartier speaks about the life he knows, and once knew. Whether it’s his obsession with Ralph Lauren, the boarding school lifestyle, the plethora of females he’s encountered, teenage love, or just being a teenager in general, Cartier knows how to manipulate his words, and gives off a clear visual of what he’s going through. Going back and forth from Connecticut and Toronto makes it hard for the 21 year old to record and put the effort needed in to his records, but so far he’s making it work. Granted, Cartier is still young, but talent is talent, and he has lots of it. The tennis playing, private school attending, luxurious teenager has a lot of time a head of him, and what he has to say is worth listening to. As a rising star in Toronto, Cartier is sure to make his city proud with what his future has in store. Read more on Last.fm.

At the same time, she also listened to more vocal-based folk, punk, and jazz like Karen Dalton, Texas Gladden, Patti Smith, and Billie Holiday. By the time she reached high-school age, Newsom decided she wanted to become a composer, and while that became the focus of her studies, in her free time she began writing and recording instrumental songs. Eventually, Newsom's passion for songwriting won out, and she began studying creative writing to work with words in the same way she was accustomed to working with music.	\N	\N	[{"tag":"17"},{"tag":"2"}]	2019-09-02 05:25:39.812+00	2019-09-02 05:26:15.463+00	2

Georgia Anne Muldrow’s jazz persona is named is Jyoti – a Sanscrit word meaning “light”- and it is the name given to her from “the great and masterful ancestor” Alice Coltrane who was a family friend. Her first record composed as Jyoti is entitled “Ocotea“- the name of an aromatic wood that her mother had recently given her, and she told me that burning this wood is what sparked the inspiration for creating the “free-jazz” sound of the album. Entirely instrumental, the 9 track experience draws from an ocean of influences such as Hendrix’s Band of Gypsys, Swamini Truiyasangitanada’s Monastic Trio, Charlie Mingus, Eric Dolphy, Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea, Henry Threadgill, Sun Ra, and Stevie Wonder – to whom she dedicates a track “Stevelander”. Ocotea is a new frontier for Georgia Anne Muldrow’s sonic discoveries. “Infused with experimental synthesizers that posses a pan-tonal sensibility, and melodies that soar about with raw musicianship!” Read more on Last.fm.

1180	Katy Perry	artist	\N	76451	\N	Katy Perry (born Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson on 25 October 1984) is a singer/songwriter from Santa Barbara, California, United States. Perry's success was so sudden in 2008 it seemed as if she was an overnight success when the opposite was true. The daughter of Pentecostal pastors, she was born Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson on October 25, 1984 in Santa Barbara, California. Raised by born-again parents, Katy was initially attracted to gospel music, sometimes sneaking pop music in to balance the inspirational tunes, but when she first started singing it was in the church. She picked up the guitar at the age of 13 and soon started writing songs, pursuing a music career in earnest when she was 15. Earning the attention of CCM artists Jennifer Knapp and Steve Thomas, Katy headed out to Nashville in 2001, where she cut demos and eventually secured a contract with Red Hill Records. Red Hill released Katy Hudson, a record targeted at a Christian/inspirational demographic, in February 2001, but the album didn't garner much attention and was ultimately buried once the label was shuttered at the end of the year. In the wake of the album's failure, Perry transitioned toward pop music, relocating to Los Angeles and working with producer Glen Ballard, the chief collaborator of Alanis Morissette, one of Katy's biggest inspirations. As she abandoned Christian music, she also abandoned her surname Hudson, choosing to use her mother's maiden name Perry instead.	\N	\N	[{"tag":"Pop"}]	2019-09-02 05:25:39.873+00	2019-09-02 05:26:15.653+00	2

Joseph Price and Evangelist Claudia Price is the 2nd of three children born and raised in Queens, NY. Under the watchful eye of her mother and the pastorate of her grandparents Bishop Jerome and Evangelist Joni Norman Kelly was nurtured and developed spiritually by being taught the word of God and the importance of a sustained prayer life through the special prayer services her grandfather held weekly in addition to Sunday services and bible study. It was there at an early age in Full Gospel Mission COGIC that the many gifts deeply rooted inside of her were watered and began to grow. It was there that her inner senses were awakened to the very real existence of God as more than just a higher power or an answer to the question “how did we all get here?”\nAt an early age Kelly’s musical talents began to dominate her life. While most babies have to be taken from the crib and calmed from crying in the middle of the night, Ms Price’s mother has been noted telling of the times when the entire house would be awakened at the sound of a young Kelly singing out in her crib while the rest of the family tried to sleep. AS a young child Kelly knew that music was more than just something that happened on the radio, in church, or even during the commercials on TV. For her it was a part of life that quickly became a necessity for life. She became emotionally dependant on the music inside of her and quickly learned how to use the music as an outlet to express what she was feeling even when she couldn’t speak about it. One day after experiencing deep sadness from a book she read for a Black history project in school, Kelly wrote a song to express her unexplainable emotions. This was her first song. She was 7 years old.	\N	\N	[{"tag":"14"},{"tag":"42"}]	2019-09-02 05:25:39.883+00	2019-09-02 05:26:15.71+00	2

1225	KOTA the Friend	artist	\N	172317	\N	KOTA The Friend is an artist from the downtown section of Brooklyn, New York. At a young age he was exposed to hip hop, R & B, Jazz and Soul music during the infamous 90's era. By the time young KOTA was 8 years old he joined his schools music program and excelled as a trumpet player. In high school KOTA was the leader of the trumpet section while teaching himself to play the guitar and piano. During this time he also picked up two weekend jobs to build a home studio where he would record hip hop tracks as well as folk songs that were accompanied by his guitar playing. During his High School days he became interested in a plethora of different artists and bands like The Beatles, J Dilla, Pink Floyd, Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and countless other acts. This inspired KOTA to start a band that would put on local showcases in the Brooklyn area that banded many aspiring artists together during this time. Some of those acts include Phony Ppl, Dyme-A-Duzin, Capital Steez formerly known as Jay Steez and many others. During his college days KOTA was introduced to an R&amp;B singer and a quirky rapper and started a hiphop/neo soul group. They would go on to play venues like The Knitting Factory and open up for Slum Village. After a year of college KOTA returned home to focus more on music. Dealing with deep depression and a lack of income he decided that although he didn't want a 9 to 5 job he needed money to sustain himself. At 19 years old he decided to pick up cinematography being that a lot of his artistic friends needed the service and he could feed that need if he were to excel at the craft. Read more on Last.fm.

1265	Lil Baby	artist	\N	27379	\N	Rapper Lil Baby grew up in Atlanta hanging with friends like Young Thug, Coach K, and Pee, leaning more toward a life of petty crime and street hustling while his friends went on to thrive in the music industry. In 2015, at age 19, Lil Baby went to prison for two years for a probation violation. Upon his release in 2017, he jump-started his rap career with a mixtape called Perfect Timing, released in April of that year. The mixtape featured cameos from friends like Lil Yachty, Young Thug, and Gunna, and strong production from 808 Mafia, Brickz, and many others, highlighted by Lil Baby's woozy flows. The mixtape immediately brought the young rapper fame, in part due to his affiliations with friends in the Quality Control family of artists as well as the 4 Pockets Full clique. As his mixtape attracted more listeners, Lil Baby worked constantly on new music, releasing singles like "My Dawg" and the Young Thug collaboration "Pink Slip" in the summer of 2017. Other 2017 releases included Harder Than Hard, 2 the Hard Way (with Marlo), and Too Hard. Lil Baby's debut studio album, Harder Than Ever, appeared in May of 2018.

Their vintage, mood ring aesthetic allows MIKNNA to create a lush, swirling soundscape, full of contemporary rap stylings, retro 80s analog production and soulful melodies, encouraging listeners to indulge in feel-good escapism and let the music take the wheel.

She’s a joy for any listener to discover—a lover and a fighter and old-soul trader in genuine energy, aiming straight for the heart. Prass turns a sly eye to the pageantry of emotion, the drama of love and the mysteries of everyday life with a disarming mixture of sincerity and cosmic insolence, unapologetically romantic, spinning golden threads of lyric and melody, each inflection and melisma planned and considered, each word tailored for meaning and effect—the pop gesture as artform.

He was then raised on the south side of Chicago. He is a member of Free Nation, a hip-hop group that promotes creative thought without accepting narrow views imposed by the powers that be. This group believes that when you find a way to combat the status quo, you are free.\n \nAt an early age, Jenkins’ mother introduced him to contemporary soul greats such as Prince, Erykah Badu, Sade and Jill Scott, thus promoting her son’s musical sensibility. The young artist was charmed by the emotions carried out in this musical genre and later found hip-hop music to be another effective vehicle for these same feelings due its lyrical richness. As he grew older, his passion for music developed into an ever-increasing rap talent.  This led him to enter a rap competition called "Who got Bars"During his sophomore year at the University of Oakwood in Hunstille, Alabama. When he was awarded second place, the prospect of a career in hip-hop crossed his mind and the chemistry he had forged with FreeNation throughout the competition inspired him to take his lyrical persuasions seriously.\n \nIn the Fall of 2012, Mick returned to Chicago and began attending YCA (Young Chicago Authors) a youth center where his first acapella verse caught the attention of local artist and leader of Chicago’s Pivot Gang collective, Saba. Shortly after, the two collaborated on “Heaux” for Saba’s 2012 mixtapeGETCOMFORTable. \n \nIn the spring of 2013 Mick Released a mixtape entitled Trees and Truths. It quickly became a local favorite, buoyed by acid jazz-influenced production, biblical allegory and lacerating lyricism. The project was by far his most lyrical body of work and caught the attention of Chicago’s incipient gatekeepers. A few months after its release, a collaboration with Chance The Rapper and Vic Mensa came in the form of a single entitled “Crossroads”, which was a summer hit.\n \nIn 2014, Mick recieved a lot of attention after the release of his single/ Visual "Martyrs". This song juxtaposes harsh truths about our society with a catchy hook, creating a thought-provoking single with various underlying messages and subtle notions.  "Martyrs" has led people such as Timberland, among others, to reach out and praise Jenkins for his musical talent and intricate lyricism. Mick continued to find creative ways to convey his message and he released his project entitled The Waters, the project received positive reviews.	\N	\N	[{"tag":"Hip-Hop"}]	2019-09-02 05:25:40.085+00	2019-09-02 05:26:16.352+00	2

1436	Nick Hakim	artist	\N	180909	\N	Born to Chilean and Peruvian parents and based in Brooklyn -- though Washington, D.C. is his hometown -- Nick Hakim arrived in 2014 as a purposefully raw and refined balladeer with an old soul. Prior to his breakout year, he appeared on Gizmo's Red Balloon album beside the likes of Gwen Bunn and Casey Benjamin, but 2014 was when he released a pair of warmly received EPs. The predominantly acoustic Where Will We Go, Pt. 1 (July) and Where Will We Go, Pt. 2 (September) pitched him somewhere between Jeff Buckley and Anthony Hamilton, albeit in a strictly low-key, singularly intimate fashion. Hakim steadily grew a fan base through his performances, including stints opening for Maxwell and King. Green Twins, his debut album, was made over the course of three years and released on the ATO label in 2017. ~ Andy Kellman Read more on Last.fm.

1433	NF	artist	\N	169754	\N	NF is the stage name of rapper and composer Nate Feuerstein from Gladwin, Michigan. Feuerstein endured a hardship-filled childhood in which his parents divorced, his mother's boyfriend physically abused him, and his mother eventually killed herself. Music was his escape, and he began recording songs on a karaoke machine, with instrumentals on one microphone and his raps in the other. Placing second in a nationwide Fine Arts Festival rap competition in 2008, and first in Michigan the following year, he independently released a debut album, Moments, in 2010. The album attracted the attention of Xist Music, which signed him to a recording deal in 2012, by which time Feuerstein had taken on the stage name NF. The label announced the release of an EP that same year, but it never appeared, and NF and Xist parted ways. NF spent the next two years looking for a label and working with local producer Tommee Profitt in his studio; they came up with the song "Wake Up," which convinced Capitol Christian Music Group to sign him. CMG released a six-song (including a Manny Marroquin remix of "Wake Up") self-titled EP late in the summer of 2014. His debut album, Mansion, was released in early 2015 and reached number 62 on the Billboard 200 while topping the Christian Albums chart. The aptly titled Therapy Session followed in 2016 and also topped the Christian Albums chart with its raw emotions and honest lyrics. The following Summer saw the release of the singles "Outro" and "Green Lights", in anticipation of the arrival of his third studio long player, Perception, whch dropped later that October.

Exuberant and youthful where Adele possessed gravitas, providing fizzy fun where Natasha Bedingfield offered nothing but cool class, Pixie Lott split the difference between these two British soul divas, finding her own niche as a pop-soul singer with classic roots but a sweet, stylish attitude. This cheerfulness brought her immediate success in Britain when she debuted in 2009. Her first two singles, "Mama Do (Uh Oh, Uh Oh)" and "Boys and Girls," went to number one in 2009, setting the stage for her successful full-length debut, Turn It Up. Lott may not have managed to crack the American charts but in the early years of the 2010s, she kept returning to the U.K. Top Ten.	\N	\N	[{"tag":"Pop"},{"tag":"R&B"}]	2019-09-02 05:25:40.231+00	2019-09-02 05:26:16.765+00	2

1480	Parquet Courts	artist	\N	90765	\N	Parquet Courts is a band from New York City.  At the center of the group is A. Savage, who at this point is known for his collaborations with projects like Fergus & Geronimo, Teenage Cool Kids and Wiccans. Savage is joined by three other musicians (“three quarters Texans and three quarters Pisces”) and describes the bands’ debut release as THE FALL meets NEIL YOUNG. On the band’s debut release, “American Specialties”, this all makes sense. The quartet wanders through the American and British underground, picking away their favorite parts with confidence. The lyrics, when intelligible, are bizarre and dramatic. “She looked at me like a fry pan reducing,” moans Savage, from the same lustful subconscious built by the darker moments of psychedelia. Then at times, such as on the 70’s folkish “Square States”, thoughts are more sentimental and transparent. The setting for “American Specialties” ranges from a crusty Brooklyn bodega, to an endless Texas desert. If that sort of soundscape appeals to your wondering mind, then I’m sure you’ll stumble across Parquet Courts sooner or later.	\N	\N	[{"tag":"Experimental Rock"},{"tag":"Garage Rock"}]	2019-09-02 05:25:40.209+00	2019-09-02 05:26:16.702+00	2

Five singles from the album reached the UK Top 30, with Shout reaching #4, and their highest charting hit, Everybody Wants to Rule the World, reaching #2.

1724	The Network	artist	\N	94880	\N	There are three artists with this name:\n1) The Network is a 5-piece New Wave/Synth Punk band from California. The band consists of all three members of Green Day and two of their touring musicians. Their stage names are Fink (Billie Joe Armstrong), The Snoo (Tre Cool), Van Gough (Mike Dirnt), Captain Underpants, and Z. It should be noted that Green Day frontman Billie Joe Armstrong's alter ego is Wilhelm Fink and Green Day drummer Tré Cool went by King Underpants in the band The Lookouts, but is reportedly The Snoo in The Network. These are clues as to the identities of the individual members, and it is known for certain that the members of Green Day are in The Network. After their album Money Money 2020, The Network added a new member to the band : Balducci.\nBillie Joe Armstrong dismisses Green Day's involvement in The Network as but a rumor, ostensibly for publicity purposes, even getting into a competitive argument with The Network. Although the style of music is different (New Wave as opposed to Green Day's pop-punk style), Armstrong's voice can be unmistakably made out on several Money Money 2020 tracks. The official Network band site claims that "Fink" put out the money for the band himself. In reality, Billie Joe Armstrong fronted the money for the band himself, and they are signed to Adeline Records, the record company he co-owns. Neither Fink/Billie Joe's or The Snoo/Tré Cool's Masks fully cover their faces, making it quite easy to discern these two members. Van Gough sings on most Network tracks in a manner similar to that of Mike Dirnt.	\N	\N	[{"tag":"Other Punk"},{"tag":"Punk"}]	2019-09-02 05:25:40.459+00	2019-09-02 05:26:17.556+00	2

He is the son of singer-songwriter Rhett Akins.[1]\nHere is some background information on Thomas Rhett from the Something To Do With My Hands Songfacts. Thomas Rhett grew up in the music industry by means of his singer-songwriter father Rhett Akins. Whilst studying business and communications at Lipscomb University in Nashville, Rhett formed a cover band and began playing frat parties and other gigs they could get. His dad persuaded him to take the stage one night at a Nashville showcase, and EMI Music's Ben Vaughn, the same publisher who had signed his father many years earlier, offered Rhett a publishing deal. \nRhett co-wrote the song "I Ain't Ready to Quit" on Jason Aldean's 2010 album My Kinda Party and signed a recording contract with Big Machine Records' Valory Music Group division in 2011.[2] In early 2012, he released his debut single, "Something to Do with My Hands". The song received a positive review from Taste of Country writer Billy Dukes, who called it "clever, but not so cheeky that the joke tires after a listen or three."[3] Read more on Last.fm.

Tweet was born in Rochester, New York and grew up singing in the church along with her parents and her four older siblings (three brothers, Tom, Cedric and Lonnie, and one sister, Sundra). Tweet mastered the guitar, playing her father's as a young girl. Tweet was inspired not only by her family but also by larger than life divas Janet Jackson, Tina Turner, Aretha Franklin and Whitney Houston (whom she later worked with). \nTweet's first steps into a career in the music industry first began when she enrolled in her local Performing Arts School. In 1990, at the age of 19, Tweet gave birth to her daughter Tashawna. The name came from a mixture of both parents name "T" from Tweet and "shawn" from Shawn, and the addition of two "a"s.\nIn the early nineties Tweet joined the female quintet Sugah, leaving her daughter with her parents in Panama City, Florida, while Tweet relocated to Virginia. Sugah was comprised of Tweet, Susan Weems, and Rolita and was a part of Devante Swing's Swing Mob collective. While there, she met Timbaland, Magoo, Missy Elliott (who at the time was a part of the Hip-Hop/R&amp;B group Sista), Playa, and Ginuwine who were also all apart of the Swing Mob collective. During her time with Sugah, Tweet formed a close friendship with Elliott.\nAround 1999 with Sugah going nowhere, no album to show, and many broken promises, Tweet returned to her parents' home in Panama City penniless and depressed. Tweet fell into deeper depression after a string of bad relationships and a number of jobs, all the while hiding her depression from her family. The depression got so bad she had planned to commit suicide. The day before she was to go through with her fateful decision she received a phone call from an old friend. That friend was Missy Elliott. She was calling to ask if Tweet would contribute background vocals on her latest album Miss E ...So Addictive. Tweet felt she could tell Elliott about her situation and what she was going through. To this day she calls Elliott her "Guardian Angel".	\N	\N	[{"tag":"Soul/R&B"},{"tag":"Urban Crossover"}]	2019-09-02 05:25:40.519+00	2019-09-02 05:26:17.776+00	2

He explained to UK music magazine the NME: "The things that I like to read are generally abstract. I like patterns, I like reading poetry and avant-garde prose and I'm more interested in musical patterns in literature than I am in long-form narratives. I look at paintings and try to visualise an object or image, then assimilate how that makes me feel into a series of phrases and try to make it musical."\nRiver To Cross Songfacts\nhttp://www.whitedenimmusic.com/	\N	\N	[{"tag":"Rock"}]	2019-09-02 05:25:40.569+00	2019-09-02 05:26:17.913+00	2

She is best known for her 2016 hit\nsingle "Ooouuu".[1][2]\nEarly life\nYoung M.A was born in 1992 in\nBrooklyn , New York . At the age of 9, she began rapping. Over the next nine years, she was residing in Virginia , although never staying in one place for long, moving to several cities while in the South. At the age of 16, she moved back to Brooklyn. [3]\nCareer\nMusic\nYoung M.A started rapping by a corner store when she was young after a few years her music career started , when she was self-funding its recording studio with local record producers , after she was working at\nShake Shack and T.J. Maxx. [4] In 2014, she gained notoriety, when a\nFacebook post criticizing her song, called "Brooklyn Chiraq" that went viral. [5] The post's author, pundit\nBoyce Watkins, said the song promoted "violent, negative, genocidal energy", but the controversy expanded Young M.A's name recognition and brought in some new listeners to her work. [3] In 2015, Young M.A released a new song, called "Body Bag", which became a "YouTube hit" said Rolling Stone, [5] along with the release of her mixtape, called Sleep Walkin ', which MTV describes as a "thoughtful debut project". [6]\nIn 2016, Young M.A released her official debut single, called "Ooouuu", [4] which peaked at number 19 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. [7] In September 2016, the song nearly had 7 million plays on Spotify [8] and was widely remixed, with other rappers and hip hop artists such as French Montana, Remy Ma,\nJadakiss , Uncle Murda , ASAP Ferg and Tink , who all of them were putting out their versions to that song. [3] At Stereogum , Tom Breihan said "Ooouuu" was "a brash, intense, hard-as-fuck piece of rider music...the song feels like it marks the arrival of a major rap talent." [9]\nThe Fader said Young M.A has "establishe[d] herself as a quintessential New York MC", [10] and at MTV, Doreen St. Félix said, "This summer, the atmosphere belongs to Young M.A and her single 'OOOUUU.'" [6] The song's popularity drew attention from labels, [11] though M.A remains an independent artist.\nAt the 2016's BET Hip Hop Awards , she did a freestyle on a cypher and performed her single, "Ooouuu", giving what XXL Magazine described as "show-stopping freestyle...one of the best freestyles of the night"; despite the enthusiasm for her performance, Young M.A expressed disappointment, saying BET cut out a portion of her performance. [12]\nOther projects\nIn 2016, in an interview with Rolling Stone, Young M.A said she'd been offered the role of Frieda Gatz on\nEmpire , but turned it down, preferring to pursue her own career as a rapper instead of being known first as a fictional character. [5]\nPersonal life\nYoung M.A is a lesbian, a topic that she includes in her music. She told\nVogue that coming out had been an important point in her artistic development, saying "I held in being sexually attracted to women for so long that once I got that out of me, the music became easy."[3]\nOn September 26th 2009, her brother was murdered by a member of his own gang. [11]\nShe is of Puerto Rican and Jamaican descent. Read more on Last.fm.

1852	Yes	artist	\N	124831	\N	Yes is a British progressive rock band which formed in London, United Kingdom in 1968. They are best known for 1970's "I've Seen All Good People", the 1972 9-minute US Top 20 smash "Roundabout" and their 1983 #1 hit "Owner of a Lonely Heart". Despite many lineup changes, occasional splits and the influence of the many changes in popular music, the band has endured for 40 years and still retains a strong international following. Their music is marked by sharp dynamic contrasts, lush harmonies, often extended song lengths and a general showcasing of members' instrumental prowess. Arguably one of the most musically ambitious bands of their genre, Yes manages to use symphonic and other so-called "classical" structures with their own blend of musical styles - including some innovations - in a happy constructive "marriage" of music.	\N	\N	[{"tag":"Progressive Rock"},{"tag":"Rock"}]	2019-09-02 05:25:40.595+00	2019-09-02 05:26:17.988+00	2

His talents were eventually fostered at Tong High School, where he delved into performing arts and stage production, even starring as Danny Zuko in the school's production of Grease. In 2010, he auditioned for The X Factor but was eliminated (along with his future One Direction bandmates, who also auditioned solo). The quintet was later brought back as a group and Simon Cowell dubbed them One Direction. Despite finishing in third place, their popularity exploded and would not slow their trajectory until the very end.	\N	\N	[{"tag":"Alternative R&B"},{"tag":"Pop"}]	2019-09-02 05:25:40.617+00	2019-09-02 05:26:18.04+00	2

2475	Freakazoid!	show	\N	45924	\N	Freakazoid! is an American animated television series created by Bruce Timm, and Paul Dini for the Kids' WB programming block of The WB. The series chronicles the adventures of the title character, Freakazoid, a manic, insane superhero who battles with an array of super villains. The show also features mini-episodes of adventures of other bizarre superheroes. The show was produced by Amblin Entertainment and Warner Bros. Animation. The cartoon was the third animated series produced by the collaboration of Steven Spielberg and Warner Bros. Animation during the animation renaissance of the late 1980s and early 1990s. With Tiny Toon Adventures and Animaniacs airing, rumors of Freakazoid! coming on the Hub Network are spreading on the internet.\n\nBruce Timm, best known as a major principal of the DC animated universe, originally intended it to be a straightforward superhero action-adventure cartoon with comic overtones, but executive producer Steven Spielberg asked series producer and writer Tom Ruegger and the Animaniacs team to turn Freakazoid! into a flat-out comedy. The show is similar to fellow Ruegger-led programs such as Animaniacs, and the humor is unique in its inclusions of slapstick, fourth wall firings, parody, surreal humor, and pop cultural references.	7.29999999999999982	1995	[{"tag":"Animation"},{"tag":"Comedy"}]	2019-09-02 05:25:43.254+00	2019-09-02 05:26:20.462+00	2

It has just under 500 shots with computer generated imagery, approximately a quarter of what a feature film would have, but the visual effects received praise from reviewers.\n\nA coming-of-age story, Forward Unto Dawn follows a cadet, Thomas Lasky, at a twenty-sixth century military training academy as it is attacked by the Covenant, an alliance of alien zealots. Lasky is unsure of his future within the military but feels pressured to follow in the footsteps of his mother and brother. Lasky and his surviving squad mates are rescued by the Master Chief and, after the death of his romantic interest, Chyler Silva, Lasky is inspired by the Chief to take initiative and aids him in saving the remaining cadets.	6.40000000000000036	2012	[{"tag":"Action"},{"tag":"Adventure"}]	2019-09-02 05:25:43.36+00	2019-09-02 05:26:20.836+00	2

2971	Mission Hill	show	\N	161754	\N	Mission Hill is an American animated television series that ran on The WB from September 24, 1999, to July 16, 2000, and on Adult Swim from July 14 to August 11, 2002. Although 18 episodes were planned, only 13 episodes were produced. The show was put on hiatus by the WB Network after two episodes due to poor ratings. It returned to the WB in the summer of 2000 but was canceled after four additional episodes. The show went on to develop a cult following, thanks to repeated airings of all 13 episodes on Teletoon's "Teletoon Unleashed" block, Cartoon Network's popular late night programing block, Adult Swim and Too Funny To Sleep, a late night programing block on TBS. Mission Hill was formerly known as The Downtowners, although MTV's production of the similarly titled Downtown forced a name change.\n\nIt has also been popular outside of the United States and Canada, receiving broadcasts in Australia, Eastern Europe, Latin America, Spain and New Zealand. Stylistically, the series is recognizable for its bright, neon color palette, and features a peculiar mixture of modern animation and traditional "cartoonish" drawings.	7.29999999999999982	1999	[{"tag":"Animation"},{"tag":"Comedy"}]	2019-09-02 05:25:43.758+00	2019-09-02 05:26:22.414+00	2

On February 14, 2011, it was moved to the Disney Junior block, serving as Playhouse Disney's replacement. It is the only Mickey Mouse program to be aimed at preschoolers. The series was co-developed by Bobs Gannaway, who is also responsible for Jake and the Never Land Pirates.\n\nProduction of the show was put on a four-month suspension in the spring of 2009, due to the death of voice artist Wayne Allwine, the longtime voice of Mickey Mouse. Production resumed when Bret Iwan has been cast as the fourth performer of Mickey's voice. On June 23, 2013, Bill Farmer, the voice actor for Goofy and Pluto, confirmed on his official Twitter account that Mickey Mouse Clubhouse would cease production after 7 years of episodes. However, reruns will still continue on the Disney Junior 24/7 service.	6	2006	[{"tag":"Animation"},{"tag":"Family"}]	2019-09-02 05:25:43.738+00	2019-09-02 05:26:22.329+00	2

2977	Mongrels	show	\N	141638	\N	Mongrels, formerly known under the working titles of We Are Mongrels and The Un-Natural World, is a British puppet-based situation comedy series first broadcast on BBC Three between 22 June and 10 August 2010, with a making-of documentary entitled "Mongrels Uncovered" broadcast on 11 August 2010. A second series of Mongrels began airing on 7 November 2011.\n\nThe series revolves around the lives of five anthropomorphic animals who hang around the back of a pub in Millwall, the Isle of Dogs, London. The characters are Nelson, a metrosexual fox; Destiny, an Afghan hound; Marion, a "borderline-retarded" cat; Kali, a grudge-bearing pigeon; and Vince, Nelson's friend, a sociopathic foul-mouthed fox.\n\nThe show is aimed at an adult audience, features "neutering, incontinence, cannibalism and catnip overdoses" and humour styles such as slapstick and farce. For example, the first episode begins with a scene in which Marion, portrayed as desperately trying to revive his deceased owner, learns she has actually been dead for four months, whereupon he casually gives his cat friends permission to eat her. Mongrels has attracted accusations of plagiarism, with claims that Mongrels stole ideas from a similar Channel 4 show called Pets.	7.5	2010	[{"tag":"Comedy"}]	2019-09-02 05:25:43.766+00	2019-09-02 05:26:22.456+00	2

3251	Saved by the Bell	show	\N	62011	\N	Saved by the Bell is an American television sitcom that aired on NBC from 1989 to 1993. The series was a retool of the Disney Channel series Good Morning, Miss Bliss. The show follows the exploits of a group of friends and their principal, and although the series primarily showcases light-hearted comedic situations, it occasionally touches on serious social issues, such as drug use, driving under the influence, homelessness, divorce, death, and environmental issues. This made Saved by the Bell a precursor to later shows that introduce young audiences to critical moral dilemmas.\n\nSaved by the Bell stars Mark-Paul Gosselaar, Dustin Diamond, Lark Voorhies, Dennis Haskins, Tiffani-Amber Thiessen, Elizabeth Berkley, and Mario Lopez.\n\nSaved by the Bell was named one of the "20 Best School Shows of All Time" by AOL TV. The show's popularity spawned two spin-off series to follow: Saved by the Bell: The College Years, a prime time series that follows several of the original characters to college, and Saved by the Bell: The New Class, a Saturday morning series that follows a new group of students at Bayside High School. The series also spawned two TV movies and a short-lived comic book series. Saved by the Bell also aired in Australia on Channel Seven, and from 1990 until 2004 on Nickelodeon. Reruns have aired in local syndication and on MTV2.	6.40000000000000036	1989	[{"tag":"Comedy"},{"tag":"Drama"}]	2019-09-02 05:25:44.067+00	2019-09-02 05:26:23.585+00	2

3257	Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated	show	\N	64975	\N	Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated is the eleventh incarnation of Hanna-Barbera's Scooby-Doo animated series, and the first incarnation not to be first-run on Saturday mornings. The series is produced by Warner Bros. Animation and Cartoon Network and premiered in the United States on Cartoon Network on April 5, 2010, with the next twelve episodes continuing, and the first episode re-airing, on July 12, 2010. The series concluded on April 5, 2013 with two seasons and fifty-two episodes, with a total of twenty-six episodes per season.\n\nMystery Incorporated returns to the early days of Scooby and the gang, when they are still solving mysteries in their home town, though it makes many references to previous incarnations of the franchise, not least among them many cases and creatures from the original Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!. Episode by episode, the series takes a tongue-in-cheek approach to the classic Scooby-Doo formula, with increasingly outlandish technology, skills and scenarios making up each villain's story, and a different spin on the famous "meddling kids" quote at the end of every episode. Contrasting sharply with this, however, are two elements that have never been used in a Scooby-Doo series before: a serial format with an ongoing story arc featuring many dark plot elements that are treated with near-total seriousness, and ongoing relationship drama between the characters.	7	2010	[{"tag":"Action & Adventure"},{"tag":"Animation"}]	2019-09-02 05:25:44.072+00	2019-09-02 05:26:23.614+00	2

3357	Star Trek: The Animated Series	show	\N	67872	\N	Star Trek: The Animated Series is an animated science fiction television series set in the Star Trek universe following the events of Star Trek: The Original Series of the 1960s. The animated series was aired under the name Star Trek, but it has become widely known under this longer name to differentiate it from the original live-action Star Trek. The success in syndication of the original live action series and fan pressure for a Star Trek revival led to The Animated Series from 1973–1974, as the source of new adventures of the Enterprise crew, the next being the 1979 live-action feature film Star Trek: The Motion Picture. The 'TAS' series was the original cast's last episodic portrayal of the characters until the "cartoon like" graphics of the Star Trek: 25th Anniversary computer game in 1992, as well as its sequel Star Trek: Judgment Rites in 1993, both of which appeared after the cast's last movie together in 1991's Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country. TAS was the first Star Trek series to win an Emmy Award.	6.90000000000000036	1973	[{"tag":"Animation"},{"tag":"Drama"}]	2019-09-02 05:25:44.171+00	2019-09-02 05:26:24.032+00	2

Trump got everything he wanted. On the rare occasion that he found himself thwarted by someone incorruptible or uncowable, he knew what to do. “I’ll wait for a more progressive administration and for bad times. When bad times come, I’ll get whatever I want.” They’re here, and so is he. Or he’s here and so, they are.	5.5	2017	[{"tag":"Documentary"}]	2019-09-02 05:25:44.341+00	2019-09-02 05:26:24.624+00	2

3621	The World at War	show	\N	163243	\N	The World at War is a 26-episode British television documentary series chronicling the events of the Second World War. At the time of its completion in 1973 it was the most expensive series ever made, costing £900,000. It was produced by Jeremy Isaacs, narrated by Laurence Olivier and includes a score composed by Carl Davis. A book, The World at War, was written by Mark Arnold-Forster, and released in 1973, to accompany the TV series.\n\nSince production was completed, The World at War has attracted acclaim and is now regarded as a landmark in British television history. Following the time of its completion, and as the Second World War remained fresh in many people's minds, the producer Jeremy Isaacs was considered ahead of his time in resurrecting studies of military history. The series focused on, among other things, portrayal of the devastating human experiences of the conflict; how life and death throughout the war years affected soldiers, sailors and airmen, civilians, the tragic victims of tyranny and concentration camp inmates.	8.30000000000000071	1973	[{"tag":"Documentary"},{"tag":"Drama"}]	2019-09-02 05:25:44.476+00	2019-09-02 05:26:25.082+00	2

Just as we sent Voyager and Pioneer probes beyond our solar system, Aliens have probes of their own that may have arrived as early as the 1600's. While Tesla was the first to successfully communicate with neighboring worlds using radio waves, we have received recent signals from intelligent sources. In 1989, Russian Space Probe Phobos 2 photographed a UFO on the surface of Mars just prior to losing contact. Scientists have determined that the craft was real and of a thin elliptical shape over 20 miles in length.

And you also get some of my favorite material that we had to cut down for the broadcast edit. The Walking Dead bit was the one that hurt the most to have to cut out for TV.

He initially agrees, causing the unstable Sawako to be committed to a psychiatric hospital.

Mayall, a capable if not exactly stellar singer and multi-instrumentalist, is best known for the many fine players who passed through his band over the years, and Eric Clapton, the most renowned of the lot, is on hand here, as is former Mayall/Rolling Stones guitarist Mick Taylor. Clapton sings several tunes in addition to playing his trademark stinging solos on "Hideaway" and "All Your Love" (two of the tunes most responsible for the "Clapton is God" graffiti seen around London in the '60s), while Taylor is mostly impressive as well.	\N	2003	[{"tag":"Music"}]	2019-09-02 05:25:48.418+00	2019-09-02 05:26:34.573+00	2

Samsara takes the form of a nonverbal, guided meditation that will transform viewers in countries around the world as they are swept along a journey of the soul. Through powerful images pristinely photographed in 70mm and a dynamic music score, the film illuminates the links between humanity and the rest of the nature, showing how our life cycle mirrors the rhythm of the planet.	7.59999999999999964	2011	[{"tag":"Documentary"},{"tag":"Music"}]	2019-09-02 05:25:50.062+00	2019-09-02 05:26:39.422+00	2
